# IgnisX - Autonomous Firefighting Drone

## Overview

IgnisX aims to leverage modern drone technology and artificial intelligence to provide rapid, autonomous fire detection capabilities. By using computer vision (YOLO object detection) running on an onboard companion computer accelerated by AI hardware, the drone is intended to identify early signs of fire without direct human intervention. This initial phase focuses on detection, with potential future expansion into localized suppression.
